# llvmup: A wrapper script for LLVM installation management.
#
# Usage:
#   llvmup [--from-source] [additional arguments...]
#
# If the flag --from-source is provided, the script calls build_llvm_source.sh
# to build LLVM from source. Otherwise, it calls llvm_manager.sh to download and install a pre-built release.
#
# Make sure that both llvm_manager.sh and build_llvm_source.sh are located in the same directory as this script.
